# Random circuit sampling on H2
==============================

Project Organization
------------
    ├── amplitudes          <- Ideal amplitudes of the measured bit strings in H2_results, computed by 
                            statevector simulation.
    └── analysis            <- Contains functions required to parse results and produce plots contained in 
                              arXiv:2406.XXXXX.
    ├── circuits            <- OpenQASM files for circuits executed on H2.
    └── results             <- Measured bit strings and ideal bit strings (if applicable) for all circuits 
                              executed on H2.
    └── system_benchmarking <- Results and analysis for component benchmarks.
